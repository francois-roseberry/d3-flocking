# flocking-js
Implementation of flocking particles with D3

Run 'grunt' on the command line in the project directory to build the sources.
It will run them through jshint, flatten and link them with browserify.
It will produce a final file target/dist.js that will be included in the file index.html,
entry point of the app. Simply run it in the browser [Only tested in Chrome though].

To setup the project after downloading the sources, install node.js, then run 'npm install'
in the project directory. That's it. After, the 'grunt' command should be available

TODO : run mocha tests with Grunt
